My `preamble.tex` file, etc., for math notes. 

Borrowed heavily from 
[gillescastel](https://github.com/gillescastel)'s 
[preamble file](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes/blob/master/algebraic-topology/preamble.tex) 
for his 
[lecture notes](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes)
and [Andrew Lin](https://web.stanford.edu/~lindrew/)'s
package, [lindrew](https://web.stanford.edu/~lindrew/lindrew.sty).
